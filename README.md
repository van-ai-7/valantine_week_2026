# 💌 A Love Letter in Code

*For the one who makes my world bloom...*

I didn't want to just give you a gift; I wanted to build you a world. This website is a small corner of the digital universe that belongs only to us. Every line of code, every falling petal, and every shifting color was thought of with you in mind.

## 🌹 Seven Days, Seven Worlds

Valentine's week is too big for just one day. That's why I've built seven different "emotional worlds" for us to walk through together.
- **The Garden of Roses**: A place where you can watch petals fall and flowers bloom at your touch.
- **The Secret Reveal**: Future days are kept as beautiful promises, locked away until the sunrise of each new day.

## ✨ The Magic I Wove for You

- **Petals that Dance with You**: As you move through the page, the rose petals respond to your touch. It's like the garden knows you're there.
- **A Sky that Changes for You**: Whether you visit me in the morning or under the moonlight, the colors of the garden will change to match the time of day.
- **Sparkling Whispers**: If you click anywhere, I've made sure a burst of hearts and sparkles appears—because that's what it feels like when I think of you.

## 🛠️ A Note for My Tech-Savvy Love

Even though this is a gift from my heart, I wanted it to be perfect.
- It's built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (pure and honest, just like us).
- I used **GSAP** so the movements felt as soft and organic as a real heartbeat.
- It works on your phone just as beautifully as on your laptop, so you can carry my love in your pocket wherever you go.

## 🚀 How to Open My Heart

1. Download the files.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Wait for the sun to rise on each new day of Valentine's week to see what else I've hidden for you.

*“I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you.”*

**Created with every bit of my heart.** ❤️
